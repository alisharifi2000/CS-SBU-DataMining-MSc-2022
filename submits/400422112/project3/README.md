# Data Wrangler - Data Mining Project

This project is hosted on [Fandogh](https://data-wrangler-hsila.fandogh.cloud/), and the API documentation is available [here](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/18655336/UzBtkNQX).

If the deployed service isn't working properly, you can use 'Dockerfile' to build a new image, run it, and test it.

There are several examples for each service in the documentation; you can switch between them by clicking on their name in the top right corner of 'Example Request' box.


*Many thanks for creating such a fun project!*
